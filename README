---------------------------Simple Project Manual--------------------------------------


    This program is does hand tracking. It places an image on top of the hand. 
    The point cloud is obtained from Microsoft's Kinect sensors.

        NOTE: Only support for 1 camera for now

    It recognizes a hand that is waving. It saves the x,y,z coordinates into 
    an array. Then, an image is placed at those x,y,z coordinates
    

======================================================================================

	"Such is oft the course of deeds that move the wheels of the world: small hands do them because they must, while the eyes of the great are elsewhere."
